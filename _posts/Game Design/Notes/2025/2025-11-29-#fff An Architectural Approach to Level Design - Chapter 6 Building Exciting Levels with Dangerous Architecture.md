Humanity’s survival instincts is a key to pleasurable design:
- Archietcture: the adherence to **spatial principles that humanity has historically identified as safe** creates the feeling of pleasure.
- Games: utilize the **emotional release** after overcoming danger as a source of pleasure.

## SURVIVAL INSTINCTS AND GAME COMPLEXITY
Gamespaces create dramatic tension by addressing both the survival of player avatars and historic notions of safe spaces.

Gamespaces: not only levels meant to maximize mechanics, but also spaces for creating dramatic tension and offering choice.

> Modernist architects dealt with buildings as places for enacting the actions of living, with Le Corbusier famously arguing that the house was “a machine for living.” Architect Robert Venturi argued that the modernists perhaps did this a little too well. In his book, he says that while the modernists succeeded in creating simplified plans, they did so by solving only certain design problems while ignoring others. To Mies van der Rohe’s maxim “less is more,” Venturi retorted, **“Less is a bore.”**

The house was the machine for living, the game level should be the machine for living, dying, and creating tension by exploiting everything in between.

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
1. Self-actualization: creativity, morality
2. Self-esteem: recognition, respect
3. Belonging-love: friends, family, spouse
4. Safety: security, stability, etc.
5. Physiological: food, water, sleep, etc.

### "Bad Spaces": Vulnerability as a Game Mechanic
- Architects should strive for pleasurable spaces through the contrast of safe and unsafe architectures that ultimately favor safety.
- Level designers can be much more heavy-handed with utilization of dangerous elements.

Enemies can be an important element levels and should be carefully planned as part of the experience of gamespaces.

“Bad spaces” in games are ones we design to put players in specific and exhilarating danger. Creating contrasts of safe and dangerous spaces from scene to scene, or even within a single scene, is one way to create gameplay complexity and “juice” level design.

#### Vulnerability as a Game Structure
Vulnerability-based design:
1. Players are confined to a small territory of a large map by powerful enemies or an environmental obstacle they cannot cross.
2. As players explore this limited space, they can find enhancements that allow them to move outside the territory.
3. Pattern repeats throughout a game.

#### Vulnerability in Individual Game Challenges
a way to implement risk–reward gameplay.

## PROSPECT AND REFUGE SPATIAL DESIGN
Refuge: an intimately sized space that was shielded from view and from which humans could look out onto prospect spaces to evaluate threats. Constrast to prospect spaces.

The ability to evaluate threats is important when discussing prospect and refuge spaces, as it is this relationship between refuges and prospects that allows us to create gamespaces with this concept.

### Creating Paths with Refuges, Prospects, and Secondary Refuges
- Primary prospects: the prospect we are looking out onto from our refuge.
- Primary refuges: the refuge we currently occupy.
- Secondary prospects: prospects far away.
- Secondary refuges: refuges in the distance.

Placing refuges along the path can impact pacing.
Example: cover to cover in fps, hiding spot to another in stealth game.

### Prospects and Refuges in Architecture
Prospect and refuge spaces are used to create a sense of *public–private* contrast:
- spaces for private actions are placed in enclosed refuges
- public gathering or circulation spaces are larger prospect spaces

Architectural refuge spaces are often on a different horizontal plane than prospect spaces:
- higher to provide an advantageous view
- lower to provide a cloistered hiding space

Ceiling height: lower ceilings create the feeling of greater protection.

> Prospect spaces are understood as uncomfortable for humans to linger in, and their uses are typically movement-based, while the uses of refuge spaces in buildings are typically static.

Le Corbusier’s architecture: largely prospect dominant
> His five points of architecture:
> 1. Piloti: thin concrete columns that form the structure of a building, typically arranged in a grid.
> 2. Free façade: since the façade is also non-structural, it can be designed freely without the need to have structural elements.
> 3. Ribbon windows: long horizontal windows that let in large amounts of light and air.
> 4. Open floor plan: unrestrained design of interior rooms since none of the walls are structural.
> 5. Roof terrace: a flat roof that can be utilized by occupants.

Frank Lloyd Wright’s architecture: largely refuge-based
> low, broad ceilings, natural materials, expansive views of the outside consistent with the Prairie School style of architecture.
> surrounding by trees as a tendency toward concealment
